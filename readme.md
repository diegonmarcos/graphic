# Backend Development Learning Path

This repository is part of a learning path focused on backend development, covering various topics from low-level system interactions to graphics programming.

The learning path is divided into three main areas:
*   **System Systems:** Understanding operating systems, processes, memory management, and networking.
*   **Algorithms:** Studying and implementing various algorithms and data structures.
*   **Graphics and Libraries:** Building graphics projects and creating reusable libraries.

## Graphic Repo

This repository contains projects related to graphics programming.

### C2_fdf (Fil de Fer)

This project is an introduction to graphics programming. It consists of rendering a 3D wireframe model from a map file. The program uses a simple graphics library (MiniLibX) to display the rendered model.

The project is structured as follows:
*   `1_RM`: Contains resources, documentation and other materials.
*   `2_SRC`: Contains the source code for the `fdf` project, including the main program, map loading, transformations, and rendering pipeline. It also contains the libraries built for the project.
