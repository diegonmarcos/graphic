This file contains functions and logic for drawing maps\&. 

This source file is part of the map drawing module of the application\&. It includes functions that handle the rendering of maps, applying various transformations and modifiers such as translation (x, y, z) and scaling\&. The file ensures that the map is drawn correctly according to the specified parameters and fits within the desireddimensions if the 'fit' parameter is set to 1\&.
.PP
The main functionalities provided by this file include:
.IP "\(bu" 2
Applying transformations to map coordinates\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Scaling the map to fit within a specified area\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Handling different rendering modes and options\&.
.PP
.PP
The functions in this file are designed to be efficient and handle large maps with minimal performance overhead\&. Proper error handling and validation are implemented to ensure robustness\&.
